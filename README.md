# cordova-plugin-mupdf
A Cordova plugin for the Android platform to open a muPdf activity.This is a fork of davearata/cordova-plugin-mupdf.
Git depending on whether it is not completed, all of my own according to the project to improve a new project. The inspiration for this project comes from the idea of a Cordova reader with a built-in PDF reader.
